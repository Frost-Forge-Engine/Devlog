Why even develop a game engine you ask ? Let me tell you this, if you read for this on the internet in most costes people are trying to discourage you saying this is an impossible thing to do. Some are saying it is an to daunting task. While they are not completly wrong their are some valid reasons why you would want to develop a custom game engine.

1. You are trying to learn how this is done
2. You want to build custom games that can't be realized in existing engines
3. You just want to have your own in house engine for you or your team
4. You dont like the tooling and / or want more customizability

These are all valid arguments, for sure.

## Why do I want to build my own engine ?

Well good question though, im kinda drawn to all of the points above. I love 2D, I love RPG's, I love MMORPG's so I wanted an engine that allows me to build just that. But I also love to learn new things so an existing engine was not the right choice for be, sure I can learn the engine, but I won't be learning principles like Rendering, Sound and so on in the depth I want. Besides that, I wanted an engine that is cross-platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS) because I'm mostly working on Linux but Gaming on Windows.

If you want more info about why one might want to build his own engine I can recommend this [post](https://medium.com/geekculture/how-to-make-your-own-game-engine-and-why-ddf0acbc5f3) on medium by Tyler Glaiel. He goes much more into detail than I am.

Well that's enough for today, see you in the upcoming posts
