## What is an engine entrypoint?
An engine entrypoint is in it's core idea a way for applications to use engine functionality. Let's look at this in more detail. For example we have an Editor that should be build upon the Frost Forge engine, we need a way to access functionality from the engine. So we are going to use the entrypoint to do exactly that. Besides that entrypoints allow us to define how every application that is build upon our engine should look like, so we are defining blueprints basically.

## What functionality does the Frost Forge Engine entrypoint provide?
Basically everything we want and need. There is no limit to what we can provide via an entrypoint implementation but we should keep in mind that we want to keep the entrypoint as lean and simple as possible. So we should only provide functionality that is needed by applications, that would otherwise be duplicated.
