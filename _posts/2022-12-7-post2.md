So as I have wrote in previous posts, I will develop a cross platform capable game engine. Therefore I had to come up with a way to build, test and run Frost Forge on different platforms. I decided to use CMake as a build system and CPM as a package manager. I will explain what those are and how I use them in this post.
There are several other options for doing the same thing, but I don't like git submodules and other build tools because there is often to much hassle getting things up and running with certain IDE's. Plus if we are using CMake we can target different IDE's like Visual Studio, XCode and CLion.

## Tools

In the following I will explain what tools I use and why I use them.

### CMake

CMake is a cross platform build tool that is used to generate build files for different build systems. It is used to build Frost Forge on Windows, Linux and MacOS. It is also used to build Frost Forge on different IDEs like Visual Studio, XCode and CLion. CMake is a very powerful tool and it is very easy to use. I will go through the CMakeLists.txt files later.

### CPM

CPM is a package manager for CMake. It is used to download and build dependencies for Frost Forge. It is very easy to use and it is very easy to integrate into CMake. I will go through the CPM.cmake file later. The main advantage of CPM is that we can use it to download dependencies for Frost Forge and we don't have to worry about the dependencies anymore. CPM will download the dependencies and build them for us. This makes it easier to work accross multiple platforms and with multiple people, if one might want to download and install my engine someday.

### CLion

CLion is an IDE for C++ development. It is very powerful and it is very easy to use. It is also cross platform and it is free for students.

### C++

I will use C++ as the programming language for Frost Forge, because of it's performance and it's cross platform capabilities. I will use C++20 as the standard, because it is a modern standard and it has a lot of new features that I will use in Frost Forge.

### Git

The source code of Frost Forge will be hosted on GitHub. I will use Git as a version control system. I will use Git to keep track of changes in the source code. This is mainly due to the fact that I am used to using Git and I like it.

## Project Structure

The project structure of Frost Forge is rather simple and expedient. We have a root directory that contains all basic configuration files for the repository, the IDE's and the compilers, as well as a main CMakeLists.txt file. Besides that we have two subdirectories, Editor and FrostForge. The Editor directory contains source code and libraries regarding the editor of the Frost Forge engine. The FrostForge directory contains source code and libraries regarding the engine itself. The source code of Frost Forge is split up into several subdirectories, that are named to represent their specific domains like platform, core, audio, etc. The Editor and FrostForge directories also contain a CMakeLists.txt file, that is used to build the editor and the engine respectively. The CMakeLists.txt files are explained in the next section. These CMake files are included in the main CMakeLists.txt file in the root project directory.

### Project Dependencies

One of the good things about this setup is that the dependencies that we need to install manually are not that much. We need to install a compiler for our OS and we need doxygen to generate the documentation.

Compilers that are supported by Frost Forge are:

- MSVC (Visual Studio)
- Clang (XCode, CLion)
- GCC (CLion)

#### Clang installation (Linux)

```bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install clang -y
```

#### GCC installation (Linux)

```bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install build-essential -y
```

If you are on Windows and want a compiler you don't have to install one separatly, just install Visual Studio, this will install the MSVC compiler automatically for you.

#### Doxygen installation

If you run on Windows go to the [official doxygen website](https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html) and download the windows installer binary.

If you are running on Linux you can use the following command to install doxygen and it's addons on your machine:

```bash
sudo apt install doxygen doxygen-doc doxygen-gui graphviz
```

## Project Setup

So lets start with setting up the project, first we will create a directory on our computer name FrostForge and initialize a git repository.

```bash
mkdir FrostForge
cd FrostForge
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/Frost-Forge-Engine/FrostForge.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Next we create the subdirectories for the editor and the engine.

```bash
mkdir -p Editor/src Editor/test Editor/vendor FrostForge/src FrostForge/test FrostForge/vendor
```

Those will be empty for now but will be filled overtime. Just in case I fill empty directories with **.gitkeep** files so that they will be checked in. Next we create the CMakeLists.txt files for the editor and the engine.

```bash
touch Editor/CMakeLists.txt FrostForge/CMakeLists.txt
```

### CMake module

For doxygen to work properly I provide CMake with a custom doxygen module.

```cmake
function(Doxygen input output)
    find_package(Doxygen)
    if (NOT DOXYGEN_FOUND)
        add_custom_target(doxygen COMMAND false
                COMMENT "Doxygen not found")
        return()
    endif()

    set(DOXYGEN_GENERATE_HTML YES)
    set(DOXYGEN_HTML_OUTPUT   ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/${output})

    UseDoxygenAwesomeCss()

    doxygen_add_docs(doxygen
            ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/${input}
            COMMENT "Generate HTML documentation"
            )
endfunction()

macro(UseDoxygenAwesomeCss)
    include(FetchContent)
    FetchContent_Declare(doxygen-awesome-css
            GIT_REPOSITORY
            https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css.git
            GIT_TAG
            v1.6.0
            )
    FetchContent_MakeAvailable(doxygen-awesome-css)
    set(DOXYGEN_GENERATE_TREEVIEW     YES)
    set(DOXYGEN_HAVE_DOT              YES)
    set(DOXYGEN_DOT_IMAGE_FORMAT      svg)
    set(DOXYGEN_DOT_TRANSPARENT       YES)
    set(DOXYGEN_HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET
            ${doxygen-awesome-css_SOURCE_DIR}/doxygen-awesome.css)
endmacro()
```

This file is called Doxygen.cmake and it is located in the cmake folder in the project root directory. This file is included in the main CMakeLists.txt file in the root directory. In this file we define a function called Doxygen that takes two arguments, the input and the output. The input is the directory where the source code is located and the output is the directory where the generated documentation will be placed. The function will check if doxygen is installed on the system, if it is not installed it will create a custom target called doxygen that will do nothing. If doxygen is installed it will generate the documentation and place it in the output directory. The macro UseDoxygenAwesomeCss will download the doxygen-awesome-css repository and set the correct options for doxygen to use it.

### Editor CMakelists.txt

Let's start with the CMakeLists.txt file for the editor. We will start with the minimum required CMake version and the project name.

```cmake
project (Editor)

set(CPM_DOWNLOAD_VERSION 0.27.2)
set(CPM_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/cmake/CPM_${CPM_DOWNLOAD_VERSION}.cmake")

if(NOT (EXISTS ${CPM_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION}))
    message(STATUS "Downloading CPM.cmake")
    file(DOWNLOAD https://github.com/TheLartians/CPM.cmake/releases/download/v${CPM_DOWNLOAD_VERSION}/CPM.cmake ${CPM_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION})
endif()

include(${CPM_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION})

# Add CPMPackages for editor here with CPMAddPackage(NAME <PackageName> VERSION <Version> GITHUB_REPOSITORY <GitRepository> GIT_TAG <GitTag>)
# Example: CPMAddPackage(NAME Warlock VERSION 0.0.1 GITHUB_REPOSITORY TheLartians/Warlock)

add_executable(FrostForge-Editor)

# Add Source files based on OS
if(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME STREQUAL "Windows")
    target_sources(FrostForge-Editor
        PUBLIC
            src/EditorApp.cpp
            src/EditorLayer.cpp
            src/EditorLayer.hpp
    )
elseif(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME STREQUAL "Linux")
    target_sources(FrostForge-Editor
        PUBLIC
            src/EditorApp.cpp
            src/EditorLayer.cpp
            src/EditorLayer.hpp
    )
elseif(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME STREQUAL "Darwin")
    target_sources(FrostForge-Editor
        PUBLIC
            src/EditorApp.cpp
            src/EditorLayer.cpp
            src/EditorLayer.hpp
    )
endif()

# Link libraries for editor here
target_link_libraries(FrostForge-Editor
    PRIVATE
        FrostForge
)
```

So what does this file define ? First I created a new CMake project called Editor, then I install CPM if not already installed. This will come in handy if we want to add dependencies to the editor later on. Next I defined a new Executable, this is a binary file that can be run on your PC. I called it FrostForge-Editor and I added all source files in the src directory to it. The source files will change for the respective OS so that we can actually be cross-platform compatible. After that I linked the FrostForge library to the editor. The FrostForge library is the engine itself and it will be explained later.

### Engine CMakeLists.txt

Now lets look at the CMakeLists.txt file for the engine.

```cmake
project( FrostForge )

set(CPM_DOWNLOAD_VERSION 0.27.2)
set(CPM_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/cmake/CPM_${CPM_DOWNLOAD_VERSION}.cmake")

if(NOT (EXISTS ${CPM_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION}))
    message(STATUS "Downloading CPM.cmake")
    file(DOWNLOAD https://github.com/TheLartians/CPM.cmake/releases/download/v${CPM_DOWNLOAD_VERSION}/CPM.cmake ${CPM_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION})
endif()

include(${CPM_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION})

# Add Global variables

            vendor/stb_image/stb_image.hpp
    )
endif()

## Link external libraries
target_link_libraries(FrostForge
    PUBLIC
        Boost
        Box2D
        GLFW
        imgui
        ImGuizmo
        glm

)

## Add pre-compiled headers
target_precompile_headers(FrostForge

        src/ffpch.hpp
)

## Add include directories
target_include_directories(FrostForge
    PUBLIC
        src
    PRIVATE
        vendor/entt/include
        vendor/Glad/include
        vendor/stb_image
        vendor/filewatch
)
```

As you can see the engine CMakeLists.txt file is a bit more complicated, so let's go through it step by step. First I created a project called FrostForge. Then I added the CPM.cmake file to the project. This file is used to add external libraries to the project. Then I added the global variables for the project. After that I added the external libraries to the project, those are all our 3rd party dependencies for now. Then I created the library and added the source files based on the OS. Next I linked the external libraries to the project. After that I added pre-compiled headers to the project. And finally I added the include directories to the project.

### Main CMakeLists.txt

Now we have to create the main CMakeLists.txt file. This file will be used to bundle the editor and the engine cmake files.

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.24.0)
project(FrostForge-Engine VERSION 0.0.1 LANGUAGES CXX)

## 64 Bit Check
if(NOT CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P MATCHES 8)
    message(FATAL_ERROR "Frost Forge Engine only supports 64-bit builds.")
endif()

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
set(CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS OFF)

#add_compile_options(-Wall -Wextra -Werror)

list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake")
add_subdirectory(FrostForge)
add_subdirectory(Editor)

include(Doxygen)
Doxygen(FrostForge/src FrostForge/docs)
```

As you can see the main CMakeLists.txt file is fairly simple. First I set the minimum required CMake version to **3.24.0**. Then I set the project name, version and language. Next I setup a 64bit check, because Frost Forge will only be supporting 64bit systems. After that I set the C++ standard to C++20 and enabled standard enforcing. Then I added the CMake module path to the project. Next I added the FrostForge and Editor subdirectories to the project. And finally I added the Doxygen documentation generator to the project.

If you payed attention closely you have seen the comment **#add_compile_options(-Wall -Wextra -Werror)**. This is commented because for now we don't need to show warnings. I will enable them later if we start to write some code.

### Other files

There are some other files in the project that are quite important so we have to add them otherwise the CMake files won't work as they are right now.

#### Manual vendor files

We have some 3rd party dependencies that are not available on CPM. Those are EnTT, Glad, stb_image and filewatch. Those are all header only libraries so we don't have to compile them. We just have to add them to the project. The files for EnTT, stb_image and filewatch can be found in the respective Github repositories. The files for Glad are not that simple, they have to be generated on a website. I will walk you through the process so you understand how it works.

Now we have to create some other files. Those are the .editorconfig, .gitattributes and .gitignore files. I will not go about the details of the .gitignore file because it is simply to large for here. The .editorconfig file is used to define the coding style for the project. The .gitattributes file is used to define the line endings for the project. I will not go into detail about those files because they are not important for the engine itself. First visit the [Glad Website](https://glad.dav1d.de/). As language choose **C/C++**, for the specification choose **OpenGL**. Choose version 4.6 for the GL API and the compatibility profile **core**. Now go to the extensions section and choose whatever you want basically, I have clicked on **Add all** because I wanted them all. Now click on **Generate** and download the zip file. Extract the zip file and copy the **glad.c** file to the **vendor/Glad/src** directory. Next copy the **glad.h** file to the **vendor/Glad/include/glad** folder. Now copy the **KHR** folder to the **vendor/Glad/include** folder.

#### Setup files
