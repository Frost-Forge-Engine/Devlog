Hey welcome to my Blog. Im Marc Hannappel, born in 1996 in Munich Germany. Im a Software Developer and I am currently learning how to develop game engines and am documenting my journey. I will occasionally write other posts to so if you are not into C++ or game engine development but into software development in general there will be something for you to read too. I hope you enjoy my blog and if you have any questions or suggestions feel free to contact me.
