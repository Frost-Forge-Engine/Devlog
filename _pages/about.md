Hey welcome to my Blog. Im Marc Hannappel, born in 1996. Im a Software Developer and I am currently learning how to develop game engines and am documenting my journey. I will occasionally post other posts to so if you are not into C++ or game engine development but into software development in general there will be something four you to read to.
